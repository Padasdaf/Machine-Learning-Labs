# Advice for Applying Machine Learning
Exploring techniques to evaluate and improve machine learning models! I worked on an error calculation function to evaluate the error on a data set for the linear regression model, a routine to calculate classification error, composing a three-layer complex model, composing a two-layer simple model, and composing a three-layer complex model with regularization.
