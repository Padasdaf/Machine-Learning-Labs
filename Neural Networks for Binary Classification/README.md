# Neural Networks for Binary Classification
A neural network to recognize the hand-written digits zero and one! I used the Keras Sequential model and Dense Layer with a sigmoid activation to construct the neural network, built a dense layer subroutine, and composed a new my_dense_v() subroutine that performs the layer calculations for a matrix of examples.
