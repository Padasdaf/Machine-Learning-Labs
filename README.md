# Machine Learning Labs
A collection of my lab assignments and projects based on the Machine Learning Specialization by DeepLearning.AI and Stanford Online. I've learned and applied fundamental techniques, including linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, decision trees, clustering, and recommendation systems. These labs provide hands-on experience as I build advanced machine learning models and neural networks using Python, NumPy, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.
