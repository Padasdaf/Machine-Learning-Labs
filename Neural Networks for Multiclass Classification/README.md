# Neural Networks for Multiclass Classification
A neural network to recognize the hand-written digits 0-9! I wrote a my_softmax() function to convert a vector of values into a probability distribution. I also utilized the Keras Sequential model and Dense Layer with a ReLU activation to construct the three-layer neural network.
